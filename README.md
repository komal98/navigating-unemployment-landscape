# Layoffs, Economy and Employee Sentiments: A Data-Driven Exploration

## Introduction
This project aims to explore the landscape of unemployment through we scraping and data analysis. We delve into layoffs, economic factors, and employee sentiments to provide a comprehensive view of the current job market.

## Data Sources

### FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data
We used the Fred API to retrieve crucial economic indices such as GDP, Interest Rates, and Unemployment Rates. This allowed us to examine long-term economic trends and volatility, patterns in unemployment over time and across geographic regions, and the efficacy of policy measures in reducing unemployment and maintaining economic stability.

### PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper
We used PRAW, a Python module that provides easy access to Reddit's API, to collect and analyze top posts from the r/technology and r/technews subreddits.

### Layoffs DataSet from Kaggle
We utilized the "Layoffs 2022" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains comprehensive records of tech industry layoffs reported across prominent platforms from March 11, 2020, to October 16, 2023.

### Layoffs.fyi
We collected data on tech layoffs by scraping the Airtable table from "Layoffs.fyi", a comprehensive database providing real-time information about layoffs in the tech industry.
